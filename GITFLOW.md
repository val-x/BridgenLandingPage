## What is GitFlow?

GitFlow is a branching model for Git that provides a robust framework for managing larger projects. It defines a strict branching model designed around the project release, making it ideal for projects with scheduled releases like our Bridgen Training website.

### Key Benefits:

- **Organized Development**: Clear separation between features, releases, and hotfixes
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously
- **Stable Production**: Main branch always reflects production-ready state
- **Easy Rollbacks**: Clear version history makes rollbacks straightforward

## Installation

### macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install git-flow-avh
```

### Windows

Git-flow is included with Git for Windows. Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-flow
```

### Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)

```bash
sudo yum install gitflow
# or
sudo dnf install git-flow
```

## Project Setup

### Initial GitFlow Setup

Navigate to your project directory and initialize GitFlow:

```bash
cd /path/to/bridgentraining
git flow init
```

When prompted, use these settings for our project:

- **Production releases branch**: `main`
- **Next release development branch**: `develop`
- **Feature branches prefix**: `feature/`
- **Bugfix branches prefix**: `bugfix/`
- **Release branches prefix**: `release/`
- **Hotfix branches prefix**: `hotfix/`
- **Support branches prefix**: `support/`
- **Version tag prefix**: `v`

### Verify Setup

```bash
git branch
# Should show:
# * develop
#   main
```

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches

#### `main` (Production Branch)

- **Purpose**: Reflects production-ready code
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production (Vercel)
- **Protection**: No direct commits allowed
- **Merges**: Only from `release/` and `hotfix/` branches

#### `develop` (Integration Branch)

- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Contains**: Latest delivered development changes
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed to staging environment
- **Merges**: From `feature/` branches and to `release/` branches

### Supporting Branches

#### Feature Branches (`feature/`)

- **Purpose**: Develop new features
- **Naming**: `feature/contact-form-validation`, `feature/course-gallery`
- **Origin**: Branch from `develop`
- **Merge**: Back to `develop`
- **Lifetime**: Until feature is complete

#### Release Branches (`release/`)

- **Purpose**: Prepare new production release
- **Naming**: `release/v1.2.0`, `release/v2.0.0`
- **Origin**: Branch from `develop`
- **Merge**: To both `main` and `develop`
- **Activities**: Bug fixes, documentation, release preparation

#### Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/`)

- **Purpose**: Fix critical production issues
- **Naming**: `hotfix/contact-form-error`, `hotfix/v1.1.1`
- **Origin**: Branch from `main`
- **Merge**: To both `main` and `develop`
- **Priority**: Highest - immediate production fixes

## Workflows

### üöÄ Feature Development Workflow

#### 1. Start a New Feature

```bash
# Start feature branch
git flow feature start contact-form-improvements

# This creates and switches to: feature/contact-form-improvements
```

#### 2. Develop Your Feature

```bash
# Make your changes
# Edit files, add components, etc.

# Commit changes regularly
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add form validation for contact form"
git commit -m "feat: improve error messaging"
git commit -m "test: add validation tests"
```

#### 3. Finish the Feature

```bash
# Finish feature (merges to develop and deletes feature branch)
git flow feature finish contact-form-improvements
```

#### 4. Push Changes

```bash
# Push develop branch with new feature
git push origin develop
```

### üì¶ Release Workflow

#### 1. Start a Release

```bash
# Start release branch from develop
git flow release start v1.2.0
```

#### 2. Prepare Release

```bash
# Update version numbers, changelog, documentation
# Fix any bugs found during testing
# No new features - only bug fixes!

git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v1.2.0"
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile responsive issues"
git commit -m "docs: update changelog for v1.2.0"
```

#### 3. Finish Release

```bash
# Finish release (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow release finish v1.2.0

# You'll be prompted for:
# 1. Merge commit message for main
# 2. Tag message for v1.2.0
# 3. Merge commit message for develop
```

#### 4. Push Everything

```bash
# Push all branches and tags
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push origin --tags
```

### üö® Hotfix Workflow

#### 1. Start Hotfix

```bash
# Start hotfix from main branch
git flow hotfix start contact-form-crash
```

#### 2. Fix the Issue

```bash
# Make minimal changes to fix critical issue
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve contact form crash on mobile devices"
```

#### 3. Finish Hotfix

```bash
# Finish hotfix (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow hotfix finish contact-form-crash
```

#### 4. Deploy Immediately

```bash
# Push to trigger immediate deployment
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push origin --tags
```

```

### üîÑ Development Workflow

#### Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day**: Pull latest changes

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create feature**: For each new task/feature

   ```bash
   git flow feature start your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Regular commits**: Commit small, logical changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add course filter functionality"
   ```

4. **Finish feature**: When complete
   ```bash
   git flow feature finish your-feature-name
   git push origin develop
   ```

#### Weekly Workflow

- **Code Review**: Review all features merged to `develop`
- **Testing**: Test `develop` branch thoroughly
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for new features

#### Release Workflow

- **Monthly/Bi-weekly**: Create release branches
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on release branch
- **Bug fixes**: Only bug fixes on release branch
- **Deploy**: Merge to main and deploy to production

### üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection

For production projects, configure branch protection:

#### Main Branch Protection

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches
- Include administrators in restrictions

#### Develop Branch Protection

- Require pull request reviews (optional)
- Require status checks to pass

### üöÄ Integration with Vercel

#### Automatic Deployments

```bash
# Production deployment (main branch)
git push origin main  # Triggers production deployment

# Preview deployment (feature branches)
git push origin feature/your-feature  # Triggers preview deployment
```

#### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

- `NODE_ENV=production` (for main branch)
- `NODE_ENV=development` (for develop branch)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. GitFlow Not Initialized

**Error**: `fatal: Not a gitflow-enabled repo yet`
**Solution**:

```bash
git flow init
```

#### 2. Branch Already Exists

**Error**: `Branch 'feature/my-feature' already exists`
**Solution**:

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/my-feature

# Start fresh
git flow feature start my-feature
```

#### 3. Merge Conflicts During Finish

**Error**: Merge conflicts when finishing feature
**Solution**:

```bash
# Switch to develop and update
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Switch back to feature and rebase
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase develop

# Resolve conflicts, then finish
git flow feature finish my-feature
```

#### 4. Accidentally Committed to Wrong Branch

**Solution**:

```bash
# If committed to main instead of feature branch
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove last commit

# Create proper feature branch
git flow feature start my-feature
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Apply the commit
```

### Getting Help

#### GitFlow Help

```bash
git flow help
git flow feature help
git flow release help
git flow hotfix help
```

#### Git Help

```bash
git help <command>
git help merge
git help rebase
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### For Bridgen Training Website

#### Feature Categories

- **UI/UX**: `feature/ui-course-cards-redesign`
- **Content**: `feature/content-student-testimonials`
- **Functionality**: `feature/func-contact-form-validation`
- **Performance**: `feature/perf-image-optimization`
- **SEO**: `feature/seo-meta-tags-improvement`

#### Release Planning

- **Major Release** (v2.0.0): New course categories, major UI overhaul
- **Minor Release** (v1.1.0): New sections, feature additions
- **Patch Release** (v1.0.1): Bug fixes, content updates

#### Deployment Strategy

```bash
# Development: feature branches ‚Üí develop ‚Üí Vercel preview
# Staging: develop ‚Üí Vercel staging environment
# Production: main ‚Üí Vercel production
```

#### Team Collaboration

1. **Feature Assignment**: Each team member works on separate features
2. **Code Review**: All features reviewed before merging to develop
3. **Testing**: Test develop branch before creating releases
4. **Documentation**: Update this guide as workflow evolves
